## Introduction

This repo will contain an API for management of a database used to list loanable books, and to record information about which books are currently being borrowed.  
This API will perform CRUD commands on an SQL database of books and users.  
User entities  will contain user data such as ID, name and email address.  
Book entities will contain details about that book, the owner's ID, and the ID of the person borrowing the book (if applicable).
